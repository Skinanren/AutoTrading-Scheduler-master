# AutoTrading Scheduler

AutoTrading Scheduler expert advisor for MT4 and MT5

AutoTrading Scheduler lets you control the time periods when AutoTrading is enabled or disabled in your MetaTrader.

You can set time periods for each of the days of the week and it will automatically disable AutoTrading outside those periods.

It can also attempt to close all trades (both open positions and pending orders) before disabling AutoTrading.

You can propose pull requests and fork this project at will.
